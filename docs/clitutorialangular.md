## CLI Tutorial Chinchay + Angular

### Overview

  For this tutorial we will have to servers running at the same time. One with the backend and another running the Angular app. 

## Backend Server

  For the backend server, follow [the cli tutorial](https://afontainec.github.io/chinchay/clitutorial). The only difference, is when running the chinchay new command, you can add the flag `--frontend disable` as follows:

```
$ chinchay new coffee --frontend disable
```

  This will not create the ejs files. We will not be needing them, we are going to do the frontend with Angular.

## Angular App

Next, we need to create an Angular app. We need to install the [Angular cli](https://angular.io/cli).
If you do not have it go and run: 

```
$ npm install -g @angular/cli
```

*NOTE*: You will need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.

Then we simply create the angular app called test_chinchay_ng

```
$ ng new testChinchayAngular && cd testChinchayAngular
```

A prompt asking if you like to add the angular routing will show, press y to confirm we will like to add it and then select the stylesheet format of your preference. We will use CSS.

Next, we will add couple of modules. In the app.module.ts file, found within the src/app directory we will add the `FormsModule` and the `HttpClientModule` to the imports:

```javascript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

import { AppRoutingModule } from './app-routing.module';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    FormsModule,
    HttpClientModule,
    BrowserModule,
    AppRoutingModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }

```

We are now ready to run our chinchay command.


## Chinchay

We install chinchay:
```
$ npm install chinchay -s
$ npm install chinchay -g
```

Then we simply run the command to create all the views and logic to work with the `coffee` relation of the backend:

```
$ chinchay new coffee --frontend angular --backend disable
```

Note we are indicating the frontend is angular and that the no backend files should be created.

This will create a coffee directory within src/app. This will include:

* Index component: Where a list of all the coffees will display.
* New component: To create a new coffee.
* Edit component: To edit an existing coffee.
* Show component: To view a coffee and its properties.
* Service: For connecting with the backend, to create, edit or retrieve data.
* Router: Configuration for the routes.

## Connecting Backend and Frontend

To connect the backend to the frontend we need to configure one more thing. In the file src/environments/environment.ts we need to add the variable `backend = http://localhost:3000`. This will indicate that the backend is running in the port 3000 of our machine.

```javascript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  backend: 'http://localhost:3000'
};
```

Last, but not least we need to add the routes to the router. The router is in `src/app/app-routing.module.ts`. We import the routes generated by chinchay and concatenate them to the end of our routes. Note, the routes variable must not be a constant.

```javascript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { Routes, RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
import { coffeeRoutes }  from './coffee/router';


let routes: Routes = [];

routes = routes.concat(carRoutes);

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
```



## Running the app

Now we are ready to run our app!.
In this tutorial we will not dig in how knex fully work. For more information on how to work around knex [click here](https://knex.org/).

First of all, we highly recommend to install knex globally:

```
$ npm install knex -g
```
<br/>
Until now we should have the following Directory Structure:

    .
    ├── bin                  
    ├── node_modules       
    ├── public   
    ├── routes
    ├── views              
    ├── app.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json

We will add the following:

    .
    ├── bin
    ├── database
        ├── migrations       
        └── seeds
            ├── development
            ├── production   
            └──  test
    ├── node_modules       
    ├── public   
    ├── routes
    ├── views              
    ├── app.js
    ├── knexfile.js        
    ├── knex.js        
    ├── package-lock.json
    └── package.json

<br/>

* database/migrations/ directory will hold all the migrations (changes) to the database.
* database/seed/ directory will hold all the seed files. Every subdirectory will hold the seed corresponding to that environment.
* knex.js Will be the instance to connect to the database.
<br/>
Go ahead and create those files

Before we continue we need to create a configuration file to let knex know how to interact with the database. We need to create a knexfile.js
```
$ touch knexfile.js
```
<br/>
Add the following code to knexfile.js

```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  test: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: 'postgres://localhost:5432/test_chinchay',
    migrations: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/migrations'),
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/seeds/test'),
    },
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 10000,
  },
  development: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: 'postgres://localhost:5432/test_chinchay',
    migrations: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/migrations'),
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/seeds/development'),
    },
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 10000,
  },
  production: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgres://localhost:5432/test_chinchay',
    migrations: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/migrations'),
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/seeds/production'),
    },
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 10000,
  },
  staging: {
    client: 'pg',
    connection: process.env.DATABASE_URL || 'postgres://localhost:5432/test_chinchay',
    migrations: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/migrations'),
    },
    seeds: {
      directory: path.join(__dirname, '/database/seeds/production'),
    },
    acquireConnectionTimeout: 10000,
  },
};

```
_NOTE:_ If your Postgres user it is not postgres change it accordingly in the connection URL.

We will not get ni detail of how this file works, but basically we are telling knex were we want to save the migrations, the seeds and what is the url to connect to the database. Note that the knexfile defines this variables for every environment by separate.


Now we need to add the following code to the knex.js file:

```javascript
const environment = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
const config = require('./knexfile')[environment];
module.exports = require('knex')(config);
```
<br/>
Now knex is configured to connect to the database.


## Using Chinchay

Now its the simple part. But before we need to create one last file:
* .chainfile.js: This file holds all of the configurations for chinchay.
<br/>
Go ahead and create this file.


In the .chainfile.js add the following:


```javascript
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  models: {
    directory: path.join(__dirname, '/models'),
  },
  controllers: {
    directory: path.join(__dirname, '/controllers')
  },
  views: {
    directory: path.join(__dirname, '/views')
  },
  routes: {
    directory: path.join(__dirname, '/routes')
  },
  knex:  path.join(__dirname, 'knex.js')
};
```
<br/>
Here we are defining which directories will hold the models, the controllers, the views and the routes.

Install chinchay:
```
$ npm install chinchay -s
$ npm install chinchay -g
```
<br/>
Installing chinchay globally will allow you to run chinchay CLI.

Lets build a new relation called coffee and the files to create, view, update and delete entries to it:

```
$ chinchay new coffee
```
<br/>
This will create a model, a controllers, views, routes and a knex migration in the directories defined in .chainfile.js.


The migrations will be saved in the directory database/migrations/. The name will vary, as it takes the current date and time to make the file, but it will be appended by an coffee.js

In this file insert the following:
```javascript
exports.up = function (knex) {
  return knex.schema.createTable('coffee', (table) => {
    // Incremental id
    table.increments();
    table.string('name').notNullable();
    table.integer('price');
    // created_at and updated_at
    table.timestamps();
  });
};

exports.down = function (knex) {
  return knex.schema.dropTable('coffee');
};
```
<br/>
This piece of code will create a relation called coffee within our database with the variables name and price. Also will generate a id and a created_at and updated_at timestamps for every entry. To run this migration:

```
$ knex migrate:latest
```
<br/>

Last, but not least, i  the app.js file, right after these lines:

```javascript
app.use('/', routes);
app.use('/users', users);
```

add the following:

```javascript
var coffee = require('./routes/coffee');
var coffeeAPI = require('./routes/coffeeAPI');
app.use('/', coffee);
app.use('/', coffeeAPI);
```
<br/>
This lines makes the app use the routes for the CRUD operations to the coffee relation.
<br/>
Now run the app:
```
$ npm start
```
<br/>
and visit [localhost:3000/coffee](localhost:3000/coffee)

Click new to create a coffee!

Enjoy!
