Making Model View Controller made easy for Express.js, Node.js and Postgres

Use a Command Line Interface to make a web app that creates, read, updated and deletes entries from a Postgres Database. Do it only with one simple command:

```
$ chinchay new coffee
```

Files Created are completely configurable.
