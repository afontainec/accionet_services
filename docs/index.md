## Command Line Interface

Use a Command Line Interface to make a web app that creates, read, updated and deletes entries from a Postgres Database. Do it only with one simple command:

```
$ chinchay new coffee
```

Files Created are completely configurable.

Do not get stuck making complex SQL queries. Chinchay makes that part easy using readable JSON object.
